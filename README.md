# alt-scheduler alpha v1.0

Remaining fixes that should be done sometime in the future:
1. Incident where user was able to make uppercase string in input (signup page) where uppercase was disabled
2. Various input labels that warn user of uppercase-disabling and space-disabling
3. Shoddy CSS
4. Forget password link should be removed as it is not feasible with current Firebase backend service.

Project temporarily on hold. Gauged user interest in Facebook group but it seems everyone else's situation was too different for this app to be useful to a sizeable amount of persons. will rather not try to fit a square peg on a circular hole. 

For now, will keep expansion ambitions small. Will give to Erica / replacements and hope to convince the boss to take over the boss duties of this app - or let the other ALTs do it. Also will try to convince the new teachers of the school year to continue using this.
